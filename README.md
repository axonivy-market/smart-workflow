# Axon Ivy Smart Ochestrator

## How to see the Agent prototype concept

1. Open the web application [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

2. Once you are in the Excalidraw designer, press **Ctrl + O**.

3. Choose the *axon-ivy-ai/tree/master/axon-ivy-ai/documents/v1.0.0/smart-orchestrator.excalidraw* file

Now you can see how the Agent prototype works.

Alternatively, you can also examine the *axon-ivy-ai/tree/master/axon-ivy-ai/documents/v1.0.0/smart-orchestrator.png* image.

## Logging

To see transport logs of requests/responses to AI models we have a sample [log4j2.xml](axon-ivy-ai/documents/v1.0.0/configuration/log4j2.xml) config.
Simply copy it into your `configuration` directory of the Designer or Engine to enable it.
The recorded logs will reside in file at `logs/ai.log`.
