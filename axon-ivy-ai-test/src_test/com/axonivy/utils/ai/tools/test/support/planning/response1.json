The goal is to create a support ticket for this issue and then create a task to handle the support ticket. The user has not provided their username, which is required to create the support ticket. We will assume the username is unknown or will need to be requested or inferred. The two tools available are createSupportTicket (to create the ticket) and createSupportTask (to create a task for the ticket). The logical sequence is to first create the support ticket with the user's query and username, then create a support task linked to that ticket.\n\n---\n**Plan:**\n- First, I will use the createSupportTicket tool to create a support ticket object. I will provide the user's original query \"Help me, my computer is beeping, it started after opening AxonIvy Portal.\" as the query parameter. Since the employeeUsername is not provided, I will note it as \"unknown\" or request it if possible.\n- Then, after successfully creating the support ticket, I will use the createSupportTask tool to create a support task. I will pass the support ticket object returned from the previous step as the supportTicket parameter.\n- Finally, this will ensure the issue is logged and a task is created to handle the support request.",
