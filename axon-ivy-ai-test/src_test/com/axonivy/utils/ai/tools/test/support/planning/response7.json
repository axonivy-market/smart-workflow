The goal is to create a support ticket and then create a task to handle it. The user did not provide a username, so \"unknown\" was used as a placeholder. The tools createSupportTicket and createSupportTask are appropriate for this workflow.\n\n---\n**Plan:**\n- First, I used the createSupportTicket tool to create a support ticket with the user's query and the username set as \"unknown\".\n- Then, I used the createSupportTask tool to create a support task linked to the newly created support ticket, specifying the issue as a technical problem.\n- This sequence ensures the issue is logged and a task is assigned for resolution.\n\nThe support ticket and task have been successfully created.",
